        "Description": "A Contingent ability is triggered on the activation or success of another “primary” ability.<br>For 1 point, the Contingent ability is only triggered when the primary ability is activated. If toughness is linked to altered form, for example, the character cannot use toughness without changing her form.<br>For 2 points, the Contingent ability is activated only with the success of the primary ability. Character Vigor might activate only after a villain successfully uses decay on a foe, for example.<br>In either case, if the primary ability is deactivated or negated, all Contingent abilities are as well. Permanent abilities that are always on, such as ageless, cannot be Contingent. "

A successful hit with the ranged attack activates the linked ability in place of its damage. Resolve the linked ability from there.<br>For example, Arrowhead has a tangle arrow tied to his bow's ranged attack. When he fires the tangle arrow and hits his target, he resolves ensnare rather than rolling damage.<br>Note that Projectile is either/or-the attacker must decide before he fires whether he's causing damage as usual or using the Projectile."

        "Description": "This Modifier can be applied to any ability that requires a Touch Attack. When taken, the character can use the ability at a range of 12”. The Touch Attack is replaced by a straight Fighting roll if the trapping summons some sort of force or material at the spot of the attack, like grasping hands, swirling spirits, or poisonous fauna. The Touch attack is replaced by Shooting or Throwing if the trapping involves firing or hurling some sort of missile such as spitting venom, tossing a grenade, or firing beams from one's hand or eyes."

With this Modifier, the character must first activate the ability as a free action. If taken by surprise, for example, the ability isn't active and has no effect.<br>This reduces the cost of the ability by 1. Requires Activation has no effect on active abilities, such as flight or attacks, since those require actions to perform already",

If the ability is normally always active, he should take 'Requires Activation' as well.<br>Once activated, the ability remains on until the character wishes to deactivate it. This might mean taking off a suit, calming down, or transforming back into human form, for example."
